# Contribute to ForrestJS

**Forks and Pull Requests are welcome!**

ForrestJS is moving its first steps so we don't have so much of a structure.
We welcome PRs to this file with propositions how to grow together to a more mature project.

Our inspiration comes from GatsbyJS and NextJS. They are great projects with a
great team and we aim to learn a lot how to handle things from them.

[[ TO BE COMPLETED ]]

## Development

Read the [DEVELOPMENT](./DEVELOPMENT.md) paper to find out some tips and tricks.

## Testing

Before you submit any PR please install [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) and run the tests:

    lerna run test

At the moment we don't have much, but a good golden rule is that your change should not
break any existing test.

**NOTE:** we welcome PRs that improve our testing!

## Documentation

The documentation of ForrestJS is a living beast on itself. We need help with it.

You can find the [Gitbook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitbook) project in this repo
under the `/gitbook` folder. [More info are available there](./gitbook/CONTRIBUTE.md).
