# NodeJS Packages - ForrestJS

Over the years, I found myself configuring some basic stuff over and over again.
Nowadays I do my best to abstract generic needs into sharable and reusable packages
that you find listed here.

Most of them consist in very little amount of code, but they provide _hooks_ so that
your application can **easily extend and customize their behaviour**.

## ForrestJS Core

This is the core of ForrestJS project. It allows you to implement extensible applications made of composable feature pretty much **like Wordpress does with their plugins**, but in a NodeJS fashion, and with traceable and debuggable support.
