# My First React App

In this tutorial you will learn how to use ForrestJS's modularity and build a truly composeable Single Page Application based on React.

## The Starting Point

We will use a [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to scaffold the basics of our application, then we will customize it so to integrate the ForrestJS Hooks library.

In your favourite Terminal app run:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-first-react-app
cd my-first-react-app
npm start
```

> ðŸ‘‰ Or you can work this out online by forking this SandBox:

## Install the Dependencies

In this toutorial we will use the following ForrestJS libraries:

```bash
npm add axios
npm add @forrestjs/hooks
npm add @forrestjs/react-root
npm add @forrestjs/react-mui
npm add @forrestjs/react-router
```
