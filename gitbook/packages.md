# ForrestJS Packages

Over many many years I found myself configuring some basic stuff over and over again.
Nowadays I do my best to abstract generic needs into sharable and reusable packages
that you find listed here.

Most of them consist in very little amount of code, but they provide _hooks_ so that
your application can **easily extend and customize their behaviour**.

## Core

#### hooks

This is the core of ForrestJS modularity. It allows you to implement an extensible applications
made of composable feature pretty much like Wordpress plugins, but in a Node fashion and with
traceable and debuggable support.
