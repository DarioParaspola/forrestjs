# ForrestJS Packages

Over the years, I found myself configuring some basic stuff over and over again.
Nowadays I do my best to abstract generic needs into sharable and reusable packages
that you find listed here.

Most of them consist in very little amount of code, but they provide _hooks_ so that
your application can **easily extend and customize their behaviour**.

## Hooks

This is the core of ForrestJS modularity. It allows you to implement extensible applications made of composable feature pretty much **like Wordpress does with their plugins**, but in a Node fashion and with
traceable and debuggable support.

ðŸ‘‰ [Install from NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@forrestjs/hooks)<br>
ðŸ‘‰ [Documentation](https://github.com/forrestjs/forrestjs/blob/master/packages/hooks/README.md#readme)

## Services

### service-env

Reads environment configuration from different _dot-files_ into your `process.env` variable, and provides a safe interface to access environmental variables.
