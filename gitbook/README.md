## Spoiler Alert

🤓 This is one of the many **opinionated setup** available on the web. 
It's mine, my own, my precious... No kidding, this is simply how 
I believe any modern web app should be organized to 
**maximize productivity** and improve **developer's experience**.

👉 Although this is by all means my own understanding of the 
_modularity challenge_, I did my best to use only existing and 
well known open source projects, and 
**limited my own code to the bare minimum**.

## Still Building...

This package is quite stable. Yet, I'm till actively working on it 
and you can expect new features and **slight changes in the APIs**.

Nevertheless I'm already using it in production, and I know quite
a few companies who trust _ForrestJS_ (and me, thanks mates 🙏) 
for their business-related projects.

🤝 I commit to do my best in preserving backward compatibility and keep 
it up-to-date with new versions of the few dependencies that we use.

WANNA HELP ME?  

## You should know...

I wrote this documentation for the mid-experienced engineer. 
It's an evolving project and **you may need to resolve to the source
code to fill the gaps** of what I have documented so far.

Let' cut it short; here is the list of the things that you should be already acquainted with:

- Javascript in general, ES6 in particular
- NodeJS, NPM, Yarn
- Fastify (or similar middleware based tool)

I don't expect you to be an expert on all those tools, but it would 
be so good if you have a basic understanding of how to use them.
