# @ForrestJS - The JavaScript Plugin Library

Hey mate, thank you for landing here!

> ForrestJS helps you build a **Modular JavaScript** application where you can (almost) forget about the infrastructure and **FOCUS ON YOUR BUSINESS VALUE**.

## Try It Out:

The easiest way to start with ForrestJS is to see it in action on CodeSandbox:

- NodeJS with Fastify demos:
  - [Basic webapp with Fastify](https://codesandbox.io/s/service-fastify-th8dq)
  - [service: Static Website](https://codesandbox.io/s/service-fastify-static-6u8mm)
  - [service: Healthcheck](https://codesandbox.io/s/service-fastify-healthz-4g3my)
  - [service: JWT](https://codesandbox.io/s/service-fastify-jwt-fnfqc)
  - [service: Cookie](https://codesandbox.io/s/service-fastify-cookie-pq2m0)
  - [service: GraphQL API](https://codesandbox.io/s/service-fastify-gql-3ijs6)
  - [service: GraphQL Client (with Apollo)](https://codesandbox.io/s/service-fastify-apollo-80oug)
  - [Handling Queues using Fetchq](https://codesandbox.io/s/service-fastify-fetchq-0by8x)
- ReactJS demos:
  - [Basic ReactJS App rendering](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-root-basic-tlo6q)
  - [Implement ReactRouter](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-router-64sw4?file=/src/index.js)
  - [Adopt MaterialUI components library](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-mui-8rx74?file=/src/index.js)

## What You Get

- Modular and interoperable architecture perfectly suited for micro-services and micro-frontends
- App's Lifecycle Extensions help coordinate the booting procedures
- Modules composition traceability and reporting
- Configuration API
- Context API
- Ready-to-use services available on NPM

## Spoiler Alert

🤓 This is one of the many **opinionated setup** available on the web.
It's mine, my own, my precious... No kidding, this is simply how
I believe any modern web app should be organized to
**maximize productivity** and improve the **Developer's Experience**.

👉 Although this is by all means my own understanding of the
_modularity challenge_, I did my best to use exclusively existing and
well known open source projects, and
**limited my own coding to the bare minimum**.

## Still Building...

This package is quite stable. Yet, I'm still actively working on it
and you can expect new features and **slight changes in the APIs**.

> I follow the **semantic versioning** practice, so you can expect breaking changs whenever you see a bump in the major version. In all the other cases I take extreeme care in respecting retro-compatibility.

Nevertheless I'm already using it in production, and I know quite
a few companies who trust _ForrestJS_ (and me, thanks mates 🙏)
for their business-related projects.

🤝 I commit to do my best in preserving backward compatibility and keep
it up-to-date with new versions of the few dependencies that we use.

WANNA HELP ME?

## Old Documentation

All the documentation is part of the [main repository](https://github.com/forrestjs/forrestjs).

You can go back in time and navigate the repo and the documentation for each release:

- [v4.1.2 docs](https://github.com/forrestjs/forrestjs/tree/2cc6e1933d1379c41393faeb6c180f9390653642/gitbook)
- [v4.1.1 docs](https://github.com/forrestjs/forrestjs/blob/f13e2a3c6225adb11776667d571685bd8a0b5997/gitbook/README.md)
- [v4.1.0 docs](https://github.com/forrestjs/forrestjs/blob/4b359a42f4154f0681d9d0955ade08957534c767/gitbook/README.md)

## You should know...

I wrote this documentation for the mid-experienced engineer.
It's an evolving project and **you may need to resolve to the source
code to fill the gaps** of what I have documented so far.

> I tested this documentation quite well, but bugs will always
> to be found!  
> **Please report them as new issues.**

Let' cut it short; here is the list of the things that you should be already acquainted with:

- Javascript in general, ES6 in particular
- NodeJS, NPM, Yarn
- Fastify (or similar middleware based tool)
- ReactJS

I don't expect you to be an expert on all those tools, but it would
be so good if you have a basic understanding of how to use them.
